>Sample codes for the full game can be found in the 'Backlog 3 Sprint2' Folder

 >Before the final code, we also did some conceptual adjustment such as:
>1. Add Background Music to the game
>2. Clean up the sound cue so that it sounds less delayed
>3. A mount for the touch panel has been created to house the screen, raspberry pi and a power bank. This now allow our game to be more portable


 >There were some other QOL that we implemented such as:
>1. Lights are programmed so that it pointed down to the player at all time, until one of the win or lose sequence is implemented
>2. Improvement to the game UI such as bigger buttons and cleaner  lock image has been added 

>Everything can be found in its respective files.
