## Overview
In this sprint of the third backlog, the tasks are to:
1. Full Game Demo
2. Conceptual Improvement
3. Quality of Life (QOL) Adjustment
   
Sample codes for the full game can be found in the 'Backlog 3 Sprint2' Folder

 Before the final code, we also did some conceptual adjustment such as:
1. Add Background Music to the game
[INSERT BGM TRACK HERE]
2. Clean up the sound cue so that it sounds less delayed
[INSERT DEMO HIGH LOW SOUND HERE]
3 A mount for the touch panel has been created to house the screen, raspberry pi and a power bank. This now allow our game to be more portable


 There were some other QOL that we implemented such as:
1. Lights are programmed so that it pointed down to the player at all time, until one of the win or lose sequence is implemented
[INSERT MA3 FILE]
2. Improvement to the game UI such as bigger buttons and cleaner  lock image has been added
