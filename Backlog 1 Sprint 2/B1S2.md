## Overview
>In this sprint of the first backlog, the tasks are to:
> 1. Configure a Laser Switching Module
> 2. A Slow Laser Sequence (<69bpm)
> 3. A Fast Laser Sequence (>69bpm)

> Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 1 Sprint2' Folder

## Configuring a Laser Switching Module
>In this project, we are using a Raspberry Pi 4. Below is a picture of the GPIO Pinouts.

</details>

>With reference to the GPIO pinouts, we are able to begin the hardware connections. Before we begin, you need:
>* 2x Laser Module
>* 2 Channel Relay Module
> * Raspberry Pi 4
>
>Please connect these hardware in the manner as shown below.

In reference to the images above, the Laser Connection Schematic currently has the relay on Normally Closed (NC), however, we will have to swap the connection from NC to Normally Open (NO).
</details>

We will be controlling the lasers via a UI as well which can be found in [music_sequene.py ](music_sequene.py) which has to include functions for turning the Laser On and Off, activating a fast laser sequence and a slow laser sequence.

## Creating a Slow/Fast Laser Sequence

> This function is for turning on the laser
```sh
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(21,GPIO.OUT)
            
def laseron():
    GPIO.output(21,GPIO.LOW)
```  

> This function is for turning off the laser
```sh
def laseroff():
    GPIO.output(21,GPIO.HIGH)
```
> for time.sleep(), the number is decided by dividing 60 by the BPM of the song

> This is for slow sequence which the song chosen is [One Love by Massive Attack](https://open.spotify.com/track/48rukEbJkzt2yUxAudbcZw?si=1486835a6aeb4cb6)
```sh
time.sleep(0.88)
```

> This is for the fast sequence which the song chosen is [High Fidelity by Daft Punk](https://open.spotify.com/track/63ZAmhkAV6Kaw955ohbEsN?si=d1615d68054f47eb)
```sh
time.sleep(0.48)
```
