## Overview
In this sprint of the first backlog, the tasks are to:
1. Configure a Laser Switching Module
2. A Slow Laser Sequence (<69bpm)
3. A Fast Laser Sequence (>69bpm)

Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 1 Sprint2' Folder

## Configuring a Laser Switching Module
In this project, we are using a Raspberry Pi 4. Below is a picture of the GPIO Pinouts.

With reference to the GPIO pinouts, we are able to begin the hardware connections. Before we begin, you need:
* 2x Laser Module
* 2 Channel Relay Module
* Raspberry Pi 4
Please connect these hardware in the manner as shown below.

  In reference to the images above, the Laser Connection Schematic currently has the relay on Normally Closed (NC), however, we will have to swap the connection from NC to Normally Open (NO).
</details>

We will be controlling the lasers via a UI as well which can be found in {add laser code here} which has to include functions for turning the Laser On and Off, activating a faster laser sequence and a slow laser sequence.

## Creating a Slow/Fast Laser Sequence
Now that we are able to turn the laser On and Off, we can create an automated sequence for the laser to follow a set amount of beats.
