## Overview
In this sprint of the third backlog, the tasks are:
1. Laser Mount Fabrication
2. Cable Fabrication
3. Laser Alignment
4. Slave Pi Preparation

Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 3 Sprint1' Folder

* [togglelaser.py](togglelaser.py) - A GUI to control the Laser Modules, including Turning On/Off **with the server**.
* [osclaser_server_V2.py](osclaser_server_V2.py) - A server to be ran on the **Master Raspberry Pi** to send a command to the Slave Raspberry Pis.
* [osclaser_trigger_V2.py](osclaser_trigger_V2.pyosclaser_trigger_V2.py) - A server to be ran on the **Slave Raspberry Pis** to receive commands from  the Master Raspberry Pi

## Hardware Setup
In this project, we are placing 2 lasers on each of the 12 speakers in the classroom, pointed at a mirror on the diaphragm to produce patterns and shapes from the vibration produced from the music played. My team specifically, is handling the 3 speaker at the back.<br>

On the middle speaker of each side, there will be a Raspberry Pi 4 as a **Slave Raspberry Pi** to receive commands from the Master Raspberry Pi in order to trigger OSC commands of GPIO.HIGH or GPIO.LOW to various relay channels which would turn the respective lasers on or off. <br>

In case reference is needed, you can refer to the Raspberry Pi 4's GPIO pinouts as shown below:
<details><summary><b>Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO Pinouts</b></summary>

</details>

With reference to the GPIO pinouts, we are able to begin the hardware connections. Before we begin, you need:
* 6x Laser Module
* 3x 2 Channel Relay Module
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Breadboard
Please connect these hardware in the manner as shown below.

The lasers are controlled via a UI as well which can be found in [togglelaser.py](togglelaser.py) which include functions for toggling Laser On and Off. 

As such, the speaker layout of the room can be seen below here:

## Code Breakdown
<details><summary><b>togglelaser.py</b></summary>
  
      def toggle_laser(laser):
    pin = pins[laser]
    GPIO.output(pin, not GPIO.input(pin))
> This function allows the toggling of the laser on and off.

```def all_on():
    for pin in pins.values():
        GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW)

# Turn all lasers off
def all_off():
    for pin in pins.values():
        GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.HIGH)
```
> <b>all_on</b> - This function turns all the laser channels on
> <b>all_off</b> - This function turns all the laser channels off

```
for laser in pins.keys():
    button = tk.Button(root, text=laser, command=lambda l=laser: toggle_laser(l))
    button.pack(pady=5)
```
>Creates the buttons for each laser according to the GPIO pins Initialised at the start of the code.

At the end, This is how our laser system will look like:
