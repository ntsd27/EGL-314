## Overview
In this sprint of the third backlog, the tasks are:
1. Laser Mount Fabrication
2. Cable Fabrication
3. Laser Alignment
4. Slave Pi Preparation

Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 3 Sprint1' Folder

* [INSERT FILE HERE](./Laser_Gui.py) - A GUI to control the Laser Modules, including Turning On/Off **with the server**.
* [INSERT FILE HERE(./osclaser_server_V2.py) - A server to be ran on the **Master Raspberry Pi** to send a command to the Slave Raspberry Pis.
* [INSERT FILE HERE](./osclaser_trigger_V2.py) - A server to be ran on the **Slave Raspberry Pis** to receive commands from  the Master Raspberry Pi

## Hardware Setup
In this project, we are placing 2 lasers on each of the 12 speakers in the classroom, pointed at a mirror on the diaphragm to produce patterns and shapes from the vibration produced from the music played. My team specifically, is handling the 3 speaker at the back.<br>

On the middle speaker of each side, there will be a Raspberry Pi 4 as a **Slave Raspberry Pi** to receive commands from the Master Raspberry Pi in order to trigger OSC commands of GPIO.HIGH or GPIO.LOW to various relay channels which would turn the respective lasers on or off. <br>

In case reference is needed, you can refer to the Raspberry Pi 4's GPIO pinouts as shown below:
<details><summary><b>Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO Pinouts</b></summary>

</details>

With reference to the GPIO pinouts, we are able to begin the hardware connections. Before we begin, you need:
* 6x Laser Module
* 3x 2 Channel Relay Module
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Breadboard
Please connect these hardware in the manner as shown below.

The lasers are controlled via a UI as well which can be found in [INSERT LASER GUI FILE HERE] which include functions for toggling Laser On and Off, **with the server Pi running**. 

As such, the speaker layout of the room can be seen below here:

So according to the spk number, it will change which GPIO pin will be triggered, after that whether the GPIO would go HIGH or LOW based on the status.
